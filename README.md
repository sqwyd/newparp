The code behind [msparp.com](http://msparp.com/), the roleplaying website for MS Paint Adventures fans, take 2.

To install, run `python setup.py develop` to install the dependencies, then `newparp_init_db` to create the database.

This is an attempt to document MSPARP's source code, since they apparently refuse to do it.
